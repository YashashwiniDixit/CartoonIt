# CartoonIt
Title : CartoonIt<br>
Description of the hack : This project inputs an image and converts it into cartoonified version. There will be three versions of the image to see an image in a fun way. First version is grayscale image while second is edges of an image and lastly we see a cartoonified image. You can also save the image in your local PC.<br>
Tech stack used : Python and its libraries <br>
Libraries and dependencies required for the project (If any): OpenCV,easygui,numpy,imageio,matplotlib,tkinter, OS and pillow<br>
Installation steps: <br>
Step 1: Importing the required modules<br>
We will need to import the following modules:<br>
CV2: Imported to use OpenCV for image processing<br>
easygui: Imported to open a file box. It allows us to select any file from our system.<br>
Numpy: Images are stored and processed as numbers. These are taken as arrays. We use NumPy to deal with arrays.<br>
Imageio: Used to read the file which is chosen by file box using a path.<br>
Matplotlib: This library is used for visualization and plotting. Thus, it is imported to form the plot of images.<br>
OS: For OS interaction. Here, to read the path and save images to that path.<br>
Step 2: Run main.py <br>
Step 3: Select picture from files.<br>
